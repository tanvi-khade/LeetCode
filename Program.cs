/*  
 *  Hello World!
 *  I am using this project as a way of keeping track of my solutions to LeetCode Problems (yes I am hoarder ;))
 *  My plan is to have one file per problem but might as well use folders if the situation demands.
 *  If you would like test any of the Problems Edit the Main() below as the question demands, hopefully I'll be able write 
 *  enough clean code for you to understand how to do that.  
 *  Cheers!
